# code repo

## You are given a code repository containing a web application built with PHP and CSS. The application is designed to display a list of e-commerce items and their details. However, the codebase has several issues that need to be addressed to improve the functionality and user experience. Your task is to improve the code by addressing the following issues:

1. Documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. Add clear and concise comments to the code explaining the purpose of each component and function, the inputs it expects, and the outputs it generates.

2. Bug fixing: The application has some bugs that need to be fixed. There are issues with loading the details of the items. You need to identify and fix these issues.

3. Code optimization: The code is inefficient and could benefit from optimization. Identify and implement improvements to optimize the code for better performance, such as reducing the number of API requests.

4. Feature enhancement: Add a new feature to the application that allows the user to search for various items by title. Implement a search bar that filters the item list based on the search query.
